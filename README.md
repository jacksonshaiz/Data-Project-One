This project has 5 portions:

Untilited Document which is the project reflection
QB-Stats which is the coding file
Wintotals;Team-Sheet(4).csv- which is a csv file I created containing NFL teams, and their amount of 2024 Wins
mergedqbstats.csv- this is the final cleaned and merged dataset. View this table in order to see my brief analysis of the data, which it should do automatically as a line in my code will generate a csv file table containing the data.
merged_qb_stats.db- this is the database that is generator from the file_transformationCSV() line at the end of the code.
To run the code, all you have to is upload the Wintotals;Team-Sheet(4).csv into your collab data storage.
