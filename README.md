This project has three portions:

Untilited Document which is the project reflection
QB-Stats which is the coding file
Wintotals;Team-Sheet(4).csv- which is a csv file I created containing NFL teams, and their amount of 2024 Wins
mergedqbstats.csv- this is the final cleaned and merged dataset. View this table in order to see my brief analysis of the data
To run the code, all you have to is upload the Wintotals;Team-Sheet(4).csv into your collab data storage.
